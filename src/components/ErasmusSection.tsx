                    During the first semester, I completed an exchange program in Lugano, a city in southern Switzerland just one hour by train from Milan.

                  I studied at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) in the academic bachelor's program "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence." I selected courses from the second and third year. In total, I took seven: Algorithm Design, Ethics, Supervised Learning, Data Visualization, Data Management, Deep Learning and Computer Vision, and Game Development. In my opinion, Algorithm Design was the most challenging.

                    I chose to participate in this exchange program because Iâ€™ve always wanted to live and study abroad, and this was the perfect opportunity. It was an amazing experience, both academically and personally.
