                    During the first semester, I completed an exchange program in Lugano, a city in southern Switzerland just one hour by train from Milan.

                    I studied at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), where I enrolled in the academic bachelor's program in "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence." I had the opportunity to take courses from both the second and third years of the program.

                <p className="text-textColorRose">
                    I chose to participate in this exchange because Iâ€™ve always wanted to live and study abroad, and this was the perfect opportunity. It was an amazing experience, both academically and personally.
