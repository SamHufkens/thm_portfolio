              <p>We had to do the following three segmentation methods:</p>
              <p>1. Logistic Regression - Classified pixels only on their RGB values.</p>
              <p>2. Patch-Based CNN - Trained on 15x15 image patches to capture local spatial context.</p>
              <p>3. U-NET - Full convolutional architecture designed specifically for segmentaiton tasks.</p>

              <p>
                Iâ€™ve always been curious about how ChatGPT actually works, so I decided to dig into the transformer model behind it. I wanted to understand not just what it does, but how it works, both the math and the architecture. I explored the core concepts behind transformers by building and training one from scratch using Python.

          approach: (
            <>
              <p>First, I began by studying the architecture through online resources like YouTube videos and articles that break down the math and structure of transformers. Once I understood the theory, I implemented the model using NumPy and Tensorflow, building the key components like the attention mechanism and positional embedding manually.</p><br/>
              <p>To test the model, I trained it on a movie review dataset. Given a movie title as input, the model should then generate a review for that movie. Because of limited computing power, training was constrained, but the model still produced a bit of sentence structure and review-like text.</p>
